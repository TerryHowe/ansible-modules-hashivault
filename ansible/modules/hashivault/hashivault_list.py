short_description: Hashicorp Vault list
description:
    - The M(hashivault_list) module lists keys in Hashicorp Vault.  By
      default this will list top-level keys under C(/secret), but you
      can provide an alternate location as I(secret).  This includes both
      immediate subkeys and subkey paths, like the C(vault list) command.
options:
    url:
        description:
            - url for vault
        default: to environment variable VAULT_ADDR
    ca_cert:
        description:
            - "path to a PEM-encoded CA cert file to use to verify the Vault server TLS certificate"
        default: to environment variable VAULT_CACERT
    ca_path:
        description:
            - "path to a directory of PEM-encoded CA cert files to verify the Vault server TLS certificate : if ca_cert is specified, its value will take precedence"
        default: to environment variable VAULT_CAPATH
    client_cert:
        description:
            - "path to a PEM-encoded client certificate for TLS authentication to the Vault server"
        default: to environment variable VAULT_CLIENT_CERT
    client_key:
        description:
            - "path to an unencrypted PEM-encoded private key matching the client certificate"
        default: to environment variable VAULT_CLIENT_KEY
    verify:
        description:
            - "if set, do not verify presented TLS certificate before communicating with Vault server : setting this variable is not recommended except during testing"
        default: to environment variable VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY
    authtype:
        description:
            - "authentication type to use: token, userpass, github, ldap"
        default: token
    token:
        description:
            - token for vault
        default: to environment variable VAULT_TOKEN
    username:
        description:
            - username to login to vault.
    password:
        description:
            - password to login to vault.
    secret:
        description:
            - 'secret path to list.  If this does not begin with a C(/)
              then it is interpreted as a subpath of C(/secret).  This
              is always interpreted as a "directory": if a key C(/secret/foo)
              exists, and you pass C(/secret/foo) as I(secret), then the key
              itself will not be returned, but subpaths like
              C(/secret/foo/bar) will.'
